      Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape and, like other
      viennoiseries, are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is
      layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then
      rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process
      results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
