      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
      but mostly associated with France. Croissants are named for their
      historical crescent shape and, like other viennoiseries, are made of a
      layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and
      folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a
      technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky
      texture, similar to a puff pastry.

      Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
      crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. Croissants have long been
      a staple of Austrian, Italian, and French bakeries and p√¢tisseries. The
      modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century. In the late
      1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, pre-formed but unbaked
      dough made them into a fast food that can be freshly baked by unskilled
      labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a
      French response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30‚Äì40% of the
      croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen
      dough.

      Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European
      countries.
